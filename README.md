## Hi there 👋 I'm Ajahar Uddin

🎓 Computer Science student focused on web development  
💻 Currently working mainly on frontend development

I build web interfaces using:
- HTML for structure  
- CSS for styling and responsive layouts  
- JavaScript for interactivity and logic  

I have experience building frontend projects and working with APIs.  
Right now, my focus is on strengthening frontend fundamentals and starting with React.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Languages: C, C++  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code  

### 📚 Currently Learning
- React (frontend development)
- JavaScript concepts in depth
- Data Structures & Algorithms (step by step)

### 🔄 Direction
I’m moving toward full-stack development by first building a strong frontend foundation, and then gradually starting backend development.

This GitHub contains my learning projects, experiments, and progress as I improve over time.
